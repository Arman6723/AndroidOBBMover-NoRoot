How to Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to Move Files in Android

Step 1: Install ADB on Your Computer

Visit the official Android developer website and download the Android SDK Platform Tools. (https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads )
Once the download is complete, extract the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.

Step 2: Enable USB Debugging on Your Android Device

On your Android device, open the Settings app.
Scroll down and tap on “About phone” or “About device”.
Find the “Build number” and tap on it 7 times. This will enable Developer options.
Go back to the main Settings screen and tap on “Developer options”.
Find and enable the “USB debugging” option.

Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to your computer.

Step 4: Open a Command Prompt or Terminal Window on Your Computer

On your computer, open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the Android SDK Platform Tools.

Step 5: Check if Your Device is Connected and Recognized by ADB

In the command prompt or terminal window, type the following command and press Enter: adb devices

This command should display the serial number of your device and its status. If the status is “device”, your device is properly connected and recognized by ADB.
Use ADB to Move Files

Method 1:
To move a file from your computer to your Android device, use the following command:
adb push /path/to/local/file /path/on/device


To move a file from your Android device to your computer, use the following command:
adb pull /path/on/device /path/to/local/file


Replace “/path/to/local/file” and “/path/on/device” with the actual paths of the files you want to move.

Step 7: Be Cautious and Double-Check Your Commands
Always double-check your commands before executing them to avoid any mistakes.


How to Use ADB Shell

Open a command prompt in the ADB folder.

Type “adb devices” to check if your device is connected and recognized by ADB.

Type “adb shell” to start the ADB shell.

Use the ‘ls’ command to list the contents of a directory. For example, ‘adb shell ls /sdcard/’ lists the contents of the /sdcard/ directory.

Use the ‘mv’ command to move folders around within the shell.


Method 2:
How to Use the move_obb_files.sh Script

Open the move_obb_files.sh script with a text editor.

Customize the source and destination paths within the script to match your needs. Don’t forget to save the changes.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Type ‘./move_obb_files.sh’ and hit Enter. The script will use ADB to move the obb files from the specified source path to the destination path on your device.
